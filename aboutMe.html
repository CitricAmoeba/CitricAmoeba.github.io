									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>

								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<p>I am a 20 year old computer science student in my second year at the University of York. Outside of my degree I keep my skills sharp by
										working on various projects in a variety of fields, learning general overviews of more advanced techniques online and taking on the occasional
										daily coding problem if I have spare time. Outside of that, I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with my friends, cooking or practising magic tricks. 
									</p>

										<h1>
										Why "CitricAmoeba" ?	
										</h1>
										As you may have noticed, I use "CitricAmoeba" a lot, both as part of this page's URL, and as part of my Discord Bot's name, not to mention numerous other instances not shown.
										This was a randomly generated name I received when I was younger and I stuck with it, eventually using it as my Github username, hence due to the way Github pages works I have to include it in the URL.
										While I could create a new Github account I believe that showing all of my work in the same place rather than across two accounts was a better approach, not to mention it better demonstrates what I'm like as a person.
